This is based on the source on the screen under the presentation here:

[Solving Problems the Clojure Way - Rafal Dittwald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)

Dittwald has illusrated **greately** the ways to do programming

- imperative (procedural)
- OO
- functional

using a game of GOPS and refactoring he demonstrated how the 3 approches is different.  And in his opinion which I quite believed successfully demonstrated how functional programming is so much better.

The source in the screen does not totally work though due to minor issues.  Hence, I put in this fixed version here.  That is [https://github.com/kwccoin/bountyJS](https://github.com/kwccoin/bountyJS) or [https://kwccoin.github.io/bountyJS](https://kwccoin.github.io/bountyJS).  Only minor issues really. 

Strangely it use Javascript and Node JS even though it said it is Clojure. For the clojure you may want to head to [https://github.com/grierson/bounty](https://github.com/grierson/bounty)
